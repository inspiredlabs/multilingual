## Raffaele and Francesca are, Marzò

> Marzò is a fresco of family, friends, hard work and chance encounters.

Marzò is Uncle Angelo who picks everything at the right time — because it’s better to do today what others postpone until tomorrow. It's Enrico who holds the photographic memory of the family. Marzò is Nonna Mia, who raises our children with the commitment of a climb, nonchalantly in her stride. And Nonna Ita who serves herbal tea down in the cold olive grove.

Marzò is the ancient olive trees planted by Great-great-grandpa Dino, one hundred years ago. It’s the tractor that has been a museum piece since the time of old Nonna Rina. It's Auntie Anna’s hand-made tortellini each and every Christmas. And Nonno Peppe, who entertains you from his soapbox in his Italian bar, with a backdrop of authentic espresso.

Marzò is Auntie Martina, who lights up the room with every visit and steals away a tear with every goodbye. It’s uncle Scott, who spends the night designing labels for round bottles… but the only olive oil bottles we find are square!

Marzò is our idea of a family business. But throughout each hectic day, right at the centre of all we do, is our heartbeat: little Martino and Ettore — brimming with life and laughter.

We are Marzò.
