      Growing hemp means rediscovering ancient seeds – which are nurtured by,
      and bound to, a distinctive piece of land and soil. Hemp tells a different
      story of farming: a story of daily care, respect and resource
      preservation.

      We grow Saffron with lots of love and hard work. After meticulously
      sorting the stigmas (the female part of the flower that produces the
      saffron spice), we dry them at low temperatures to lock in aroma and
      taste.

      We work to preserve the ancient art of growing olive trees. We are mindful
      of protecting our environment and landscape. And we are committed to
      promoting and developing a culture of olive oil – inviting anyone who
      chooses liquid gold for their kitchen to become a discerning customer. As
      producers, we apply ethics that value the Italian craft of nurturing olive
      groves to extract exquisite oil – in the multitude of local varieties that
      enrich our *Bel Paese*.
